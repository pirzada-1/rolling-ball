### **Project Plan: Rolling Ball Simulation in a Hexagon**

This project plan outlines the main tasks, technical considerations, and timeline for developing a Python simulation of a rolling ball inside a hexagon with gravity and air resistance effects.

---

### **Project Objectives:**
1. Develop a physics-based simulation of a ball moving within a hexagonal boundary.
2. Incorporate gravity and air resistance effects on the ball’s motion.
3. Implement collision detection and response with the hexagon’s edges.
4. Visualize the simulation in real-time using `pygame`.

---

### **Main Tasks:**

#### **1. Project Setup**
- Install required libraries (`pygame`).
- Set up the Python environment and project structure.

#### **2. Hexagon Representation**
- Define the hexagon’s vertices using a function.
- Ensure the hexagon is centered on the screen.

#### **3. Ball Physics Implementation**
- Create a `Ball` class with attributes for position, velocity, and radius.
- Implement motion equations incorporating gravity and air resistance.

#### **4. Collision Detection**
- Develop a function to detect collisions between the ball and the hexagon’s edges.
- Handle collisions by reflecting the ball’s velocity vector and applying damping.

#### **5. Visualization**
- Use `pygame` to render the hexagon and ball.
- Update the simulation in real-time with a fixed frame rate.

#### **6. Testing and Debugging**
- Test the simulation for correctness in physics, collision handling, and visualization.
- Debug any issues and optimize performance if necessary.

#### **7. Documentation**
- Document the code and provide explanations for key functions.
- Write a brief user guide on how to run the simulation.

### **Technical Considerations:**

#### **Physics Model**
- Use Newtonian physics to calculate the ball’s velocity and position:
  - `velocity = velocity + (gravity - air_resistance * velocity) * dt`
  - `position = position + velocity * dt`

#### **Hexagon Representation**
- Represent the hexagon as a list of vertices calculated using trigonometric functions.

#### **Collision Handling**
- Use vector math to detect collisions and reflect the ball’s velocity based on the edge’s normal vector.
- Apply damping to simulate energy loss during collisions.

#### **Visualization**
- Use `pygame` for 2D rendering and real-time animation.
- Ensure smooth frame rates by limiting updates to 60 FPS.
